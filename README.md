# Testing Javascript by Kent C. Dodds

This repo is created for learning purposes only. It contains the code from the course [Testing Javascript](https://testingjavascript.com/) by Kent C. Dodds.

Each section has code that I have written by going through the course and some notes that I write surrounding it. I do not own this code, but I keep it as a good refresher on the concepts that I have learned.
